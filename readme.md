## CPSC 4970 Project 6 - Spring 2023 Term B

Student: Gene Mueller

This is option 1 (PyQt5 interface) that works with the League Database projects
we've worked on in previous modules. The 'ui' module contains the ui files 
(both qt and python logic) while the 'model' module contains the backend logic.
The 'test' module contains the test for the backend functions.
